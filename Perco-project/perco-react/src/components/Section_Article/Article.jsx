            <h1 className='sect2__h1'>DENIAL. ITS FORMS AND INFLUENCE ON EFFICIENCY AT WORK.</h1>
                    <p>Introduction</p>
                    <p>Denial is one of the forms of destructive communication between company employees. Very 
often this form of communication is used in communication between a subordinate and a 
boss, but also in linear communications between equivalent employees. There is only one 
goal of this form of communication: to evade responsibility, not admit mistakes, and not 
change anything in the process of work. If this behavior is manifested by a subordinate during 
communication with superiors, this is a direct attack on the authority of the superior and an 
attempt to manipulate responsibility. This behavior excludes the possibility of employee 
development and is direct sabotage of work. Denial comes in various forms. We will look at 
the main ones, with explanations and examples</p>

<p>1) <span className='sect_2_direct'>Direct denial</span> - an explicit form of denial of problems and mistakes that is 
very easy to recognize.  This is expressed in a clear rejection of the very 
possibility of error or wrong actions. Usually expressed in phrases: <br />  <br /> 
- I can’t be wrong. <br />  
- I know what to do myself. <br /> 
- I don't need advice. <br /> 
- I myself will decide how to act  <br /> 
- It is impossible that I acted incorrectly. <br />   <br /> 
Such a denial cuts off the opportunity for the interlocutor to give an 
alternative opinion, feedback on the situation, to express a possible solution 
that is not within the boundaries of the denier’s understanding of the 
situation. Yes, we all understand that an alternative opinion or vision of a 
situation does not mean that it will always be correct or bring any benefit, but 
someone who denies this cannot know, and in advance excludes the 
possibility that the interlocutor will express a constructive position or an 
effective solution to the problem. This creates a dangerous precedent, since 
those who deny by such actions form an erroneous opinion about their</p>

                  <div className="section2">
        <div className="sect4-bg2 mb-3"  style={{ 
      backgroundImage: `url(${img2})`
    }}

          <div className="container-fluid2">

                    <p>which he is to blame, he immediately, sometimes without even noticeable to 
you, tries to add another topic to your topic of conversation. which, 
according to his calculations, will interest you more, or is more important for 
you than what you wanted to discuss with him. Such a denier tries to do this 
unnoticed in order to switch your attention to other topics and divert your 
focus from those problem areas where he needs to take responsibility for 
mistakes, wrong actions, or inaction, and even consequences. Here are some 
examples of such denial:</p>
<p>2) <span className='sect_2_direct'>Minimization</span> 

another form of denial, using which the employee tries to 
distort the real size of errors, incorrect actions and, using this form, 
minimize his responsibility and consequences. This is pure manipulation, 
by an employee who chooses adaptation like a chameleon, instead of 
responsibility and subsequent development through his mistakes and 
negative experiences. And instead of taking responsibility and gaining 
new experience, the employee chooses a way to minimize his 
responsibility, in which he does not recognize the volume and seriousness 
of wrong actions, but tries to downplay their significance. This directly 
leads to degradation in development and efficiency. This type of denial is 
usually expressed in the phrases: <br /> <br />
- I know that this is not right, but it is not as serious as others think.  <br />
- I don't make mistakes very often. <br />
- It doesn’t matter, I’ll fix everything, let’s move on. <br />
- Well, now we will waste time on these minor mistakes.  <br /> 
- Listen, this is not such a serious conflict that we need to do something. <br />
- It doesn’t matter how he reacts, he’s just an ordinary worker.  <br />
- Don’t pay attention to this (mistakes, incorrect behavior), we have more 
important things to do.  <br /> <br />
3) <span className='sect_2_direct'>Avoiding topics</span> is another type of denial. The employee jumps from topic 
to topic in different ways, thereby not giving the opportunity to specify his 
mistakes and wrong actions in order not to take responsibility for them. As a 
rule, your interlocutor knows you and what topics concern you or are 
important to you, and as soon as you start discussing problematic areas in
</p>

      backgroundImage: `url(${img3})`
    }}
    >
        
          <div className="container-fluid2">
            <div className="section2__txt">
            {/* <h1 className='sect2__h1'>fesf</h1> */}
                    <p>which he is to blame, he immediately, sometimes without even noticeable to 
you, tries to add another topic to your topic of conversation. which, 
according to his calculations, will interest you more, or is more important for 
you than what you wanted to discuss with him. Such a denier tries to do this 
unnoticed in order to switch your attention to other topics and divert your 
focus from those problem areas where he needs to take responsibility for 
mistakes, wrong actions, or inaction, and even consequences. Here are some 
examples of such denial: <br /> <br />
- Yes, we will discuss this, but listen to a very important thing (he then 
changes the topic).  <br /> <br />
- I agree with you, and this is part of ... (change of topic).  <br />
- Listen, yes, this is important, but I’m sure it’s related to (smooth transition 
to another topic a little similar, but not related to the interlocutor’s mistakes).  <br /><br />


- Let's discuss issues that carry greater risks for you and then come down to 
it (during this time the interlocutor simply throws out topics, sometimes 
shows problems where there are none and insists on solving them in order 
to exhaust the time limit to no avail, but will not return to the problem for It’s 
a question of where responsibility should be taken.).  <br /><br />
-At this moment we urgently need to discuss another problem. (and if, when 
you try to return to discussing the mistakes or responsibility of the 
interlocutor, he again and again finds more important topics or jumps from 
topic to topic already open in the conversation, this is a manifestation of this 
form of denial) <br /><br />
There can be many variations of such denial, the main goal is to take you 
away from determining responsibility by any means. Bombard you with a 
variety of topics, find a question that worries you more, just so as not to 
clarify the responsibility for mistakes, inaction or incorrect actions. <br /> <br />

                    <p>4) <span className='sect_2_direct'>Denial through a third party</span> is a very common form of denial in which an 
employee, in order to reduce his responsibility for wrong actions, errors or 
inaction, creates a picture in which part of the responsibility shifts to a third 
party. Examples: <br /> <br /> 
- Listen, if you worked like me 24 hours a day, you would also make such 
mistakes.<br /> <br /> 
- If you had as much responsibility as I do, you too would be ineffective at 
the end of the day.<br /> <br /> 
- I haven’t had a vacation for almost a year, how can I work effectively or not 
make mistakes?<br /> <br /> 
-I’ll look at you if, in addition to work, you have two more children and a lot 
of problems at home. <br /> <br /> 
- If we had a more convenient office, I would work better. <br />  <br /> 
Yes, these factors really influence work efficiency directly or indirectly, but 
in what cases is this a denial, and in what cases is it a real statement of facts? 
If an employee uses such explanations in response to an attempt to show 
him his responsibility for inaction, mistakes, or incorrect actions, then this is 
clearly a denial, with the help of which the employee tries to shift part of the 
responsibility to circumstances or another person. So , when is it just a fact 
or an argument? When employees are notified in advance of possible risks 
and reduced efficiency due to indirect or direct problems in their lives. But 
employees always keep silent about these facts, fearing that other employees 
or superiors will regard this as an unloyal employee, weak and unable to cope 
with ordinary difficulties. And this pushes the employee into such forms of 
denial, instead of directly voicing the situation in advance, in order to allow 
the manager to redistribute the workload between employees and, when 
giving tasks, commands or instructions, take into account the risks of 
reduced efficiency of the employee in a given period. This is effective 
management, but most employees play “superman” and when responsibility 
for inefficiency or mistakes arises, they try to reduce or avoid it through this 
denial, which is a worse form than telling the truth in the first place. Let's </p>

        <div className="sect4-bg5 mb-3"  style={{ 
      backgroundImage: `url(${img5})`
    }}
    >
        
          <div className="container-fluid2">
            <div className="section2__txt">
            {/* <h1 className='sect2__h1'>fesf</h1> */}
            <p>imagine the situation. Your interlocutor is aware of these forms of denial. Do
you think he will respond more positively when you communicate your
ineffectiveness or the risk of mistakes due to some circumstances, or when
he sees that you are avoiding responsibility through denial or trying to
reduce it?
</p>
                    <p>5) <span className='sect_2_direct pe-1'>Denial through conflict</span>is a very easily defined form of denial. When you
try to talk about responsibility, the employee provokes conflict in various
forms. This is not necessarily open conflict, in which people shout at each
other or openly insult each other. The denier’s task is to conduct a dialogue
in such a way as to force you to react emotionally to his provocations that
are not related to the topic of discussion. Each person has sensitive topics,
touching on which, the denier will cause you to react or need to respond to
him, thereby involving you in a hidden conflict and leading you away from
the topic of responsibility (visually it may not manifest itself through raising
your voice or direct insults). As a rule, for provocation they use jokes with
sarcasm, voicing a negative assessment of your qualities, reminders
condemning your past mistakes to reduce the significance of your words,
provocative questions, humiliating remarks in your direction in front of other
employees. In general, everything that you cannot remain silent and not react
to.
  </p>
  <p>6) <span className='sect_2_direct pe-1'>Rationalization</span>is a form of denial when an employee finds a seemingly
logical explanation for wrong actions or errors or inactions. Usually it creates
a picture that in this case it was the only correct way out. What is the danger
of this type of denial? The fact is that when choosing an explanation for his
mistake, the employee uses logical chains that play on your fears, shifting
responsibility onto you, creating a “choice without choice” situation, this is
when, explaining his behavior or mistake, the employee creates the illusion
in your head that if If he had not acted this way, it would have been even
worse, forcing you to believe that his action or inaction was correct. For
example: <br /> <br />
- I just talked to him. If I had conveyed your words to him as you asked, he
would most likely quit his job, and we don’t have a replacement. Can you
imagine the headache that would cause you?
  </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div className="section2">
        <div className="sect4-bg6 mb-3"  style={{ 
      backgroundImage: `url(${img6})`
    }}
    >
        
          <div className="container-fluid2">
            <div className="section2__txt">
            {/* <h1 className='sect2__h1'>fesf</h1> */}
                    <p>Let's look at this example in more detail. Here there is an employee’s failure
to fulfill the clearly defined task of “conveying a certain message”, after
which there is a rationalization of such behavior. But what's really going on?
When an employee is given instructions to clearly convey certain words, who
is responsible for the consequences and possible reaction of the employee
to whom these words will be spoken? The one who gave the command to
convey these words. By giving a command or instruction, he takes
responsibility for the consequences of this instruction, but in our case, the
employee fulfilled the instruction partially or in his own way, but at the same
time, through rationalization, he tries to leave responsibility on the one who
gave this instruction. With the help of rationalization, the person in denial
seeks the consent of the one who gave the command, and accordingly shifts
responsibility for his own independent actions and inactions to the person
who asked for something completely different and was ready to bear
responsibility for his own decision and not for the improvisation of the
employee to whom he gave a clear instruction. Let's look at another example: <br /> <br />
- If I don't put pressure and yell at him, he will stop working altogether. <br /> <br />
In this example, the employee is rationalizing his actions in relation to
another employee. Are pressure and yelling a stimulating factor at work? Yes,
for a short time. Because the main stimulant is used - fear and stress. But
with a constant mode of such communication, the employee either begins to
get used to it and ignore such pressure (in order to protect himself), or begins
to burn out due to the constant reaction to such communication. So what is
the denial here? This lies in the fact that the one who uses this technique,
instead of admitting his inability to find a way to build effective
communication with such an employee, uses a completely unpromising
method of influence, not recognizing his part and not wanting to learn
something new and develop, rationalizing his destructive actions. Let's look
at another rationalization option: <br /> <br />
- I couldn't do otherwise in that situation. <br /> <br />
This rationalization is often used to justify a mistake. With the help of these
words, the person in denial creates the illusion that there was no choice and
he acted using the only available method. Why this denial? The employee </p><br /> <br />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="section2">
        <div className="sect4-bg7 mb-3"  style={{ 
      backgroundImage: `url(${img7})`
    }}
    >
        
          <div className="container-fluid2">
            <div className="section2__txt">
            {/* <h1 className='sect2__h1'>fesf</h1> */}
                    <p>does not take responsibility for the mistake, and therefore does not gain new
experience. This phrase uses two negations: “rationalization” and “denial
through a 3rd party.” <br /> <br />
7) <span className='sect_2_direct'>Intellectualization</span> is also an easily recognizable form of denial. When a
person in denial justifies his inaction, mistakes or wrong actions, with the
help of the culture in which he grew up, upbringing, national characteristics
of personal views, and so on. Let's look at examples: <br /> <br />
- Why are you shutting up this employee, you don't let him say a word! -
Where I grew up, when the elders speak, the younger ones must remain
silent. <br /> <br />
- Listen, let’s better entrust this matter to Mark, believe me, it’s better not to
entrust such matters to women. <br /> <br />
- Why the hell should you listen to his problems, he hasn’t worked for us for
even a year. <br /> <br />
Such denial leads to the fact that destructive management methods,
decision-making methods, and personal views and values, often erroneous
and destructive for the effective building of working relationships, are
dragged into the company’s communication and even some decisions
related to the company’s work. This often pushes workers to take one side
or another and creates subgroups within the company formed not on work
interests but on supporting or denying someone's personal preferences and
views. <br /> <br />
8) <span className='sect_2_direct'>Reference to authority</span> is another form of denial that closes the road to
development and the ability to take responsibility for one’s mistakes. It is
usually expressed in the form of communication, when the denier cites as an
example the erroneous actions of a boss or an authoritative employee,
justifying his own mistakes, instead of solving and correcting them, gaining
new experience and developing. Examples: <br /> <br />
- You also made mistakes when you started working in this company.</p> <br />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="section2">
        <div className="sect4-bg8 mb-3" style={{ 
      backgroundImage: `url(${img8})`
    }}
    >
        
          <div className="container-fluid2">
            <div className="section2__txt">
            {/* <h1 className='sect2__h1'>fesf</h1> */}
                    <p>- Look, Matthew always shouted at the workers and achieved a lot. <br /> <br />
- The boss mixed me up with shit for the first two years, and I turned out to
be a successful person, so now I educate my employees the same way.<br /> <br />
That is, the person in denial justifies his mistakes, while creating in you the
illusion that it was precisely such actions that made someone successful or
made it possible to achieve results. But with this type of denial, he is silent
that the main factors of success were hard work, knowledge, constant work
on oneself, the ability to be responsible, have management skills and
constant sacrifices of one’s health, nerves and, often, time for the family. And
he puts forward only that part of behavior that justifies his own mistakes. <br /> <br />
9) <span className='sect_2_direct'>Comparison</span> - this type of denial shifts the focus of your attention to the
problems of other workers, reducing my own. When a remark is made, or a
mistake or irresponsibility is shown, the response is given examples of the
same actions, but with worse consequences. For example:<br /> <br />
- So what if I lost a million this month, compared to Matthew it’s nothing, he
lost ten.<br /> <br />
- What’s wrong with that I came home drunk, for example, Paulus, drunk,
constantly beats his wife.<br /> <br />
- I’m manipulating ? , but no, you should see how Matthew talks, I’m generally
a straightforward person.<br /> <br />
- These are not big losses, our competitors lost 5 times more.
This type of denial is very common in companies, but it is also often used in
private life. The goal is one, to avoid responsibility or reduce the
consequences.<br /> <br />
10) <span className='sect_2_direct'>Diagnosis</span> - this type of denial works by connecting your consciousness
not to the problem of error or wrong actions, but to human reasons that are
understandable to you, which you can easily understand and even join in this
opinion. This is a game with your human understanding of processes, but in <br /> <br /> </p>

        <div className="sect4-bg9 mb-3" style={{

    }}
    >
        
          <div className="container-fluid2">
            <div className="section2__txt">
            {/* <h1 className='sect2__h1'>fesf</h1> */}
                    <p>fact, this is the same avoidance of responsibility and, accordingly, an easy
way for justification, instead of change. Examples: <br /> <br />
- All people make mistakes, I am also just a person.<br /> <br />
- Well, what can you expect from me, of course I misunderstood.<br /> <br />
- Well, you know that I am such a person, I always do everything slowly, but
for that I am strong in finance.<br /> <br />
- Being late is my illness, but I always stay late in the office after work.<br /> <br />
- Listen, I’m a pedant and I check every little thing ten times, so I’m often late
with the delivery of material.<br /> <br /><br />
<span className='sect_2_direct'>Bottom line.</span> <br /> <br />
We looked at the main forms of denial. There are many more of them and it is
very difficult to study, remember and track them all. These are used most
often in business communications. The purpose of these forms of denial is
only one - to avoid responsibility, reduce consequences, not make efforts to
learn and develop, and maintain a comfortable zone. Within a business, such
manipulations are considered sabotage of work, since they cause direct
damage to communications within the company, create an incorrect
distribution of responsibilities, and also create an unhealthy competitive
environment. The ability to take responsibility is what makes a leader a
leader. An employee who voices to you his goals such as development,
growth, loyalty to the company and at the same time uses these types of
denial, this means only one thing, either he is lying, or has no idea how to
achieve the stated goals, and therefore is not competent.</p>
