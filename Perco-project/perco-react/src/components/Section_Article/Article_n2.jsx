people pleasing on effective work.   </span> 
</h1>
                    <p>Often, what we consider politeness is not really such. At work, in business 
communications, this is especially dangerous, because the consequences 
of such behavior are conflicts, resentments, and unrealistic expectations. 
What is people pleasing? This is when I do or say something to please 
another person, so that the opposite part has an opinion about me that is 
favorable to me. For example, I don't agree with someone’s opinion, and I 
can even prove my position, but instead I nod my head and agree, because 
this is my boss, or I don’t want to create a conflict, or it’s easier for me to 
agree than to enter into a dialogue. Or I think that the person still won’t 
understand, that is, I already have a preconceived opinion about this 
person. Sometimes people pleasing is used to resolve conflict situations, 
mistakenly believing that it helps. So how to determine whether this is 
just politeness or people pleasing? It's actually easy, I just have to ask 
myself one question, what goal am I achieving in this case by using this 
behavior? If your answer is that there is no goal, then this is your culture 
band this is normal, but in all other cases it is people pleasing  <br /> <br />

People pleasing is never used naturally, just like that, and always has a 
purpose. Even if I believe that this is a positive goal, the method of 
achieving this is destructive. People pleasing is a type of manipulation and 
lying when I put on a mask and create an unreal picture to achieve a goal. 
This is an easy path, because if you act constructively, you need to learn 
new things, work on fears, and change yourself. But people always look 
for easy ways. In the end, it brings destruction to those who use this 
behavior <br /> <br />

Now let's take a closer look at the situations with people pleasing that I 
described. For example, a boss or another person puts pressure on you 
with their opinion and you choose to remain silent or agree so as not to 
escalate the situation. As a person, I understand your behavior and fears, 
but in a business structure, this is unacceptable. Why. When you are afraid 
to express your opinion with reason, the other side automatically accepts 
your silence and passivity as agreement with what was said or vision, and 
psychology works in such a way that the person who tells you his opinion, 
goals or arguments automatically creates expectations from you in his 
head. And if you do not voice your opinion and position, but do it another 
time, later, then this will already look like a betrayal, because of your

                    <p>passivity the person has created expectations that you agree with him. 
This leads to hidden conflicts in the company. Why do people do this for 
only one reason, because they don’t know how to act in such a situation, 
how to correctly show their position and opinion without creating a 
conflict or angering their boss or another person. It is ignorance of how to 
act that creates fear, and fear pushes people to use people pleasing. <br /> <br />
Let's look at resolving conflict situations. In these decisions, people 
pleasing is also very often used, justifying it by the fact that it is necessary 
to look for a compromise or by the fact that using such behavior will help 
resolve a conflict situation. And you know what, it has the opposite effect. 
Why? Any conflict has a clear solution algorithm. And any other actions 
only worsen the situation. How the conflict is resolved:
<br /> <br />
<span className='sect_2_direct'>1) First, the object of the conflict is clearly defined . For example, if I ask 
why you are angry, and you say that you are just tired, but in fact you are 
offended that I didn’t do something or did something wrong, then we see 
the object (reason) of your anger in different ways and will never resolve 
this conflict . So the object of conflict need to be detected. <br /> <br />
2) The parties involved in the conflict determine the step-by-step actions 
of each to resolve the conflict and confirm that this will end the conflict <br /> <br />
3) The parties carry out the planned actions to resolve the conflict<br /> <br />
4) The parties check the implementation of the actions of each party and 
confirm that these actions have been completed in full and there are no  
more complaints <br /> <br /> </span>


Only after this the conflict is considered over. Any other methods of 
resolving conflict situations lead to the fact that one of the parties is not 
satisfied and then it turns into a hidden conflict that affects teamwork. 
The offended party then looks for allies in the team and subgroups are 
formed, which instantly reduces the company’s competitiveness and its 
profits. We can say that this is deadly for business. This is how ordinary 
people pleasing affects work <br /> <br /> What exactly does the use of such behavior as people pleasing show us? 
One very important thing is that if I use this, it means I don’t have enough 
knowledge to solve the situation in which I use it, or I don’t have enough 
knowledge of how to achieve this or that goal without using people 
pleasing. Or I have created the wrong destructive experience of behavior

                    during my life and continue to use it, mistakenly believing that it will give 
results <br /> <br />

And by continuing to use this, you deprive yourself of the opportunity to 
develop and gain the right knowledge that will help you become more 
effective at work and, accordingly, more competitive. Maybe my words 
will seem too direct and harsh to you, but I believe that employees who 
use such behavior as people pleasing are employees who sabotage the 
work of the company because they do not want to develop their 
knowledge and use behavioral tools that are very dangerous to the 
business. In personal life, this is everyone’s business, but not in business 
communications, since the company pays for the consequences. <br /> <br />

<span className="sect_2_direct pe-1">How can this be fixed?</span>
Remember this system, it will help you develop 
yourself and be more effective. Once a week, take a sheet of paper and 
analyze how your week went and in what situations you used people 
pleasing. Be sure to describe the situation. For example, Boss called me 
and in the conversation I did people pleasing, remember specifically what 
topic you discussed or what the situation was, maybe you received 
criticism. On a piece of paper you will have a list of specific situations 
where you used this behavior. These are your weak points, where you do 
not have enough experience and knowledge and therefore fear arises, and 
it is fear that pushes us to use people pleasing. This way you will know 
what knowledge you need to develop to solve this. This may be the ability 
to communicate, or have a facts conversation, or you have low self-esteem 
and this fear pushes you to such actions. You will see a real picture of 
yourself. <br /> <br /> 

As for low self-esteem, it is important to know in which areas I have low 
self-esteem, because low self-esteem creates fears, I don’t know how to 
act, and in order to fight these fears, people often choose not to develop 
their knowledge, but to grow their ego. For example, I don’t know how to 
solve the situation and I used people pleasing and solved the situation. 
Wow, it worked, but what happened at that moment. I did not improve my 
self-esteem because I gained new knowledge and experience, I grew my 
ego that I can already solve situations with less work. And so, step by step, 
the worker grows his ego. What's wrong with that, you ask? Self-esteem is 
when I have a real picture of myself, my capabilities, when I really <br /> <br />

                    understand what I can do. And the ego is an unreal picture of me, which I 
myself came up with and proved to myself because of the actions that I 
described above, and I sincerely believe in this unreal picture of me, even 
trying to prove it to others. But the problem is that 90% of the decisions I 
make based on my Ego and not self-esteem are wrong and lead to wrong 
 .results. In business and work, this is expressed in losses for the company <br /> <br />
